# Sales-Prediction-Analysis

This project aims to understand the relationship between different advertising channels, such as TV, Radio, Newspapers, and product sales.

# Project Overview
The goal of the project is to provide actionable insights for a business by calculating future sales predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset used is the "Advertising" dataset, containing 200 samples of spending across three channels.
**Source**: Available through "Archive.zp" attached above.

# Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1. Data Loading & Cleaning           - pandas
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)   - seaborn and matplotlib
3. Data Preparation                  - scikit-learn
4. Model Building                    - LinearRegression
5. Model Evaluation

# Key Findings & Results

1. Strongest Predictor: TV 
2. Model Performance: R-squared (R^2) value of approximately 0.90 or 90%.
3. Coefficients: For every $1,000 spent on TV advertising, sales are predicted to increase by approx 54 units, holding other factors constant.

# Technologies Used
1. Python 3
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib & Seaborn
6. Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
